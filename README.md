# Introduction 
We are built it ECMAScript and we contain the basic functionality to define our components. This module will handle DOM interaction with a Renderer. We focus on getting the best perfomance we can by managing the current use of virtual memory.

# Getting Started
1) Set the core base project as a library:
    - Go to the core base project.
    - Put on the console: "npm link".
    - Back to the consumer and put in the console: "npm link [name of linked project]". In this case: "npm link robotjscorebase".
2) Run the file index.js with node in the console: Ex. -> node index.js

# Build and Test
First you have to install npm dependencies by puting this on the CMD: npm install -y
